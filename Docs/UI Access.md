* By editing the manifest file (JL.exe.manifest) you can change uiAccess="false" into uiAccess="true". This allows JL to stay on top of other applications that do not have UI Access even without clipboard change (e.g. JL will be on top of Magpie even before any clipboard change occurs) and allows JL to keep itself on top of other applications that do have UI Access on every clipboard change. If you choose to grant JL UI Access, there are 2 conditons that must be met:
  1) You should either place JL in a "secure location" (e.g. "Program Files", "Program Files (x86)") or you can disable the "Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations" policy through "Edit group policy" ->"Computer Configuration"->"Windows Settings"->"Security Settings"->"Local Policies"->"Security Options"->"User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations". If you choose to do the former, you need to run JL as administrator, otherwise JL will face problems. If you choose to do the latter, please read this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-only-elevate-uiaccess-applications-that-are-installed-in-secure-locations) first before proceeding.
  2) You should either create a certificate, install it to your system and sign JL with it, or you can install the provided certificate. Note that the provided certificate is a self-signed one, you can read more about self-signed certificates from this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate). If you choose to do the former, here's a guide that can help: [link](https://support.smartbear.com/testcomplete/docs/working-with/automating/via-com/configuring-manifests.html#SignApp). If you choose to do the latter, you can install it by right clicking to JL.exe->Properties->Digital Signatures->Select "JL" from "Signature List"->Details->View Certificate->Install Certificate->Local Machine->Select "Place all certificates in the following store"->Browse->Select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"->OK->Next->Finish
