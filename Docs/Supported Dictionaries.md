Note: JL *can* import Yomichan dictionaries with structured content but it will strip the non-content parts (e.g. HTML tags) so whether the displayed result will be satisfactory depends on the dictionary. It's recommended to avoid using dictionaries like "JMdict for Yomichan" and "Jitendex" that essentially have the same data as JMdict. Since JL already supports the JMdict itself, using these dictionaries will only result in an inferior user experience on JL.
