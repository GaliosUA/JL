## FAQ
### Why can't I look anything up?
Make sure you're not in transparent mode, kanji mode, have lookup-on-select-only enabled, or have disabled lookups (default: Q key).
### How do I disable transparent mode?
Press the opacity slider button located top-left of the main window.
### How do I add EPWING dictionaries?
Select the folder containing the **unzipped** (so you should have a folder of files named like term_bank_1.json, term_bank_2.json...)  contents of a dictionary converted with https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import on the Dictionaries tab in Preferences. 
### Will you add machine translation capabilities?
No.
